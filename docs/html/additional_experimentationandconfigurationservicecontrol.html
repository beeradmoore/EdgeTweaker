<h3>ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl</h3>

<h4>Control communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service</h4>

<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<ul>
<li>On Windows and macOS since 77 or later</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>The Experimentation and Configuration Service is used to deploy Experimentation and Configuration payloads to the client.</p>

<p>Experimentation payload consists of a list of early in development features that Microsoft is enabling for testing and feedback.</p>

<p>Configuration payload consists of a list of recommended settings that Microsoft wants to deploy to optimize the user experience.</p>

<p>Configuration payload may also contain a list of actions to take on certain domains for compatibility reasons. For example, the browser may override the User Agent string on a website if that website is broken. Each of these actions is intended to be temporary while Microsoft tries to resolve the issue with the site owner.</p>

<p>If you set this policy to 'FullMode', the full payload is downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service. This includes both the experimentation and configuration payloads.</p>

<p>If you set this policy to 'ConfigurationsOnlyMode', only the configuration payload is downloaded.</p>

<p>If you set this policy to 'RestrictedMode', the communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service is stopped completely. Microsoft does not recommend this setting.</p>

<p>If you don't configure this policy on a managed device, the behavior on Beta and Stable channels is the same as the 'ConfigurationsOnlyMode'. On Canary and Dev channels the behavior is the same as 'FullMode'.</p>

<p>If you don't configure this policy on an unmanaged device, the behavior is the same as the 'FullMode'.</p>

<p>Policy options mapping:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>FullMode (2) = Retrieve configurations and experiments</p></li>
<li><p>ConfigurationsOnlyMode (1) = Retrieve configurations only</p></li>
<li><p>RestrictedMode (0) = Disable communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.</p>
