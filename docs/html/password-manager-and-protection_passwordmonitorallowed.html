<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<li>On Windows since 85 or later</li>
<li>On macOS since 93 or later</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Allow Microsoft Edge to monitor user passwords.</p>

<p>If you enable this policy, the user will get alerted if any of their passwords stored in Microsoft Edge are found to be unsafe. Microsoft Edge will show an alert and this information will also be available in Settings > Passwords > Password Monitor.</p>

<p>If you disable this policy, users will not be asked for permission to enable this feature. Their passwords will not be scanned and they will not be alerted either.</p>

<p>If you don't configure the policy, users can turn this feature on or off.</p>

<p>Additional guidance:</p>

<p>This policy can be set as both Recommended as well as Mandatory, however with an important callout.</p>

<p>Mandatory enabled: If the policy is set to Mandatory enabled, the UI in Settings will be disabled but remain in 'On' state, and a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - "This setting is managed by your organization."</p>

<p>Recommended enabled: If the policy is set to Recommended enabled, the UI in Settings will remain in 'Off' state, but a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - "Your organization recommends a specific value for this setting and you have chosen a different value"</p>

<p>Mandatory and Recommended disabled: Both these states will work the normal way, with the usual captions being shown to users.</p>
