<h3>TLS13HardeningForLocalAnchorsEnabled</h3>

<h4>Enable a TLS 1.3 security feature for local trust anchors (obsolete)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 85.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<ul>
<li>On Windows and macOS since 81, until 85</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to upgrade affected proxies.</p>

<p>This policy controls a security feature in TLS 1.3 that protects connections against downgrade attacks. It is backwards-compatible and will not affect connections to compliant TLS 1.2 servers or proxies. However, older versions of some TLS-intercepting proxies have an implementation flaw which causes them to be incompatible.</p>

<p>If you enable this policy or don't set it, Microsoft Edge will enable these security protections for all connections.</p>

<p>If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will disable these security protections for connections authenticated with locally-installed CA certificates. These protections are always enabled for connections authenticated with publicly-trusted CA certificates.</p>

<p>This policy can be used to test for any affected proxies and upgrade them. Affected proxies are expected to fail connections with an error code of ERR<em>TLS13</em>DOWNGRADE_DETECTED.</p>
