<h1>EfficiencyMode</h1>

<h2>Configure when efficiency mode should become active</h2>

<h2>Supported versions</h2>

<ul>
<li>On Windows and macOS since 96 or later</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This policy setting lets you configure when efficiency mode will become active. By default, efficiency mode is set to 'BalancedSavings'. On devices with no battery, efficiency mode is disabled by default and will not become active. Please note that Windows Energy Saver settings can influence when efficiency mode becomes active on all devices.</p>

<p>Individual sites may be blocked from participating in efficiency mode by configuring the policy <a href="SleepingTabsBlockedForUrls.md">SleepingTabsBlockedForUrls</a>.</p>

<p>Set this policy to 'AlwaysActive' and efficiency mode will always be active.</p>

<p>Set this policy to 'NeverActive' and efficiency mode will never become active.</p>

<p>Set this policy to 'ActiveWhenUnplugged' and efficiency mode will become active when the device is unplugged.</p>

<p>Set this policy to 'ActiveWhenUnpluggedBatteryLow' and efficiency mode will become active when the device is unplugged and the battery is low.</p>

<p>Set this policy to 'BalancedSavings' and when the device is unplugged, efficiency mode will take moderate steps to save battery. When the device is unplugged and the battery is low, efficiency mode will take additional steps to save battery.</p>

<p>Set this policy to 'MaximumSavings' and when the device is unplugged or unplugged and the battery is low, efficiency mode takes additional steps to save battery.</p>

<p>If the device does not have a battery, efficiency mode will never become active in any mode other than 'AlwaysActive' unless the setting or <a href="EfficiencyModeEnabled.md">EfficiencyModeEnabled</a> policy is enabled.</p>

<p>This policy has no effect if the <a href="EfficiencyModeEnabled.md">EfficiencyModeEnabled</a> policy is disabled.</p>
