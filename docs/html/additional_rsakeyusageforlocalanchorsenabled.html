<h3>RSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabled</h3>

<h4>Check RSA key usage for server certificates issued by local trust anchors (obsolete)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 135.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<ul>
<li>On Windows and macOS since 123, until 135</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>The X.509 key usage extension declares how the key in a certificate can be
used. These instructions ensure certificates aren't used in an unintended
context, which protects against a class of cross-protocol attacks on HTTPS and
other protocols. HTTPS clients must verify that server certificates match the
connection's TLS parameters.</p>

<p>Starting in Microsoft Edge 124, this
check is always enabled.</p>

<p>Microsoft Edge 123 and earlier have the
following behavior:</p>

<p>If this policy is set to enabled,
Microsoft Edge will perform this key
check. This helps prevent attacks where an attacker manipulates the browser into
interpreting a key in ways that the certificate owner did not intend.</p>

<p>If this policy is set to disabled,
Microsoft Edge will skip this key check in
HTTPS connections that negotiate TLS 1.2 and use an RSA certificate that
chains to a local trust anchor. Examples of local trust anchors include
policy-provided or user-installed root certificates. In all other cases, the
check is performed independent of this policy's setting.</p>

<p>If this policy is not configured,
Microsoft Edge will behave as if the
policy is enabled.</p>

<p>This policy is available for administrators to preview the behavior of a
future release, which will enable this check by default. At that point, this
policy will remain temporarily available for administrators that need more
time to update their certificates to meet the new RSA key usage requirements.</p>

<p>Connections that fail this check will fail with the error
ERR<em>SSL</em>KEY<em>USAGE</em>INCOMPATIBLE. Sites that fail with this error likely have a
misconfigured certificate. Modern ECDHE_RSA cipher suites use the
"digitalSignature" key usage option, while legacy RSA decryption cipher suites
use the "keyEncipherment" key usage option. If uncertain, administrators should
include both in RSA certificates meant for HTTPS.</p>

<p>The policy has been obsoleted starting from Microsoft Edge version 136,
but the key check has been always enabled since Microsoft Edge version 124.</p>
