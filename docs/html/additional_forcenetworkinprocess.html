<h3>ForceNetworkInProcess</h3>

<h4>Force networking code to run in the browser process (obsolete)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 83.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<ul>
<li>On Windows since 78, until 83</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to migrate to 3rd party software that doesn't depend on hooking networking APIs. Proxy servers are recommended over LSPs and Win32 API patching.</p>

<p>This policy forces networking code to run in the browser process.</p>

<p>This policy is disabled by default. If enabled, users are open to security issues when the networking process is sandboxed.</p>
