<h3>AdHocCodeSigningForPWAsEnabled</h3>

<h4>Native application signing during Progressive Web Application installation</h4>

<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<ul>
<li>On macOS since 132 or later</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Enabling this policy or leaving it unset enables the use of ad-hoc signatures for the native application that's created when installing a Progressive Web Application (PWA). This ensures that each installed application has a unique identity to macOS system components.</p>

<p>Disabling this policy will result in every native application created when installing Progressive Web Applications having the same identity. This can interfere with macOS functionality.</p>

<p>Only turn off the policy if you are using an endpoint security solution that blocks applications with an ad-hoc signature.</p>
