<h3>IntensiveWakeUpThrottlingEnabled</h3>

<h4>Control the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature</h4>

<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<ul>
<li>On Windows and macOS since 85 or later</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>When enabled the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature causes Javascript timers in background tabs to be aggressively throttled and coalesced, running no more than once per minute after a page has been backgrounded for 5 minutes or more.</p>

<p>This is a web standards compliant feature, but it may break functionality on some websites by causing certain actions to be delayed by up to a minute. However, it results in significant CPU and battery savings when enabled. See https://bit.ly/30b1XR4 for more details.</p>

<p>If you enable this policy, the feature will be force enabled, and users will not be able to override this setting.
If you disable this policy, the feature will be force disabled, and users will not be able to override this setting.
If you don't configure this policy, the feature will be controlled by its own internal logic. Users can manually configure this setting.</p>

<p>Note that the policy is applied per renderer process, with the most recent value of the policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full restart is required to ensure that all the loaded tabs receive a consistent policy setting. It is harmless for processes to be running with different values of this policy.</p>
