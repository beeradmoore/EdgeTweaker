<h3>EnableSha1ForLocalAnchors</h3>

<h4>Allow certificates signed using SHA-1 when issued by local trust anchors (obsolete)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 91.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<ul>
<li>On Windows and macOS since 85, until 91</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>When this setting is enabled, Microsoft Edge allows connections secured by SHA-1 signed certificates so long as the the certificate chains to a locally-installed root certificate and is otherwise valid.</p>

<p>Note that this policy depends on the operating system (OS) certificate verification stack allowing SHA-1 signatures. If an OS update changes the OS handling of SHA-1 certificates, this policy might no longer have effect.  Further, this policy is intended as a temporary workaround to give enterprises more time to move away from SHA-1. This policy will be removed in Microsoft Edge 92 releasing in mid 2021.</p>

<p>If you don't set this policy or set it to false, or the SHA-1 certificate chains to a publicly trusted certificate root, then Microsoft Edge won't allow certificates signed by SHA-1.</p>

<p>This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.</p>
