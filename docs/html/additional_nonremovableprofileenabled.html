<h3>NonRemovableProfileEnabled</h3>

<h4>Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account</h4>

<h4>Supported versions:</h4>

<ul>
<li>On Windows since 78 or later</li>
</ul>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This policy determines if a user can remove the Microsoft Edge profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account.</p>

<p>If you enable this policy, a non-removable profile will be created with the user's work or school account on Windows. This profile can't be signed out or removed. The profile will be non-removable only if profile is signed-in with either on-premises account or Azure AD account that matches OS sign-in account.</p>

<p>If you disable or don't configure this policy, the profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account on Windows can be signed out or removed by the user.</p>

<p>If you want to configure browser sign in, use the <a href="#browsersignin">BrowserSignin</a> policy.</p>

<p>This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management.</p>

<p>From Microsoft Edge 89 onwards, if there is an existing on-premises profile with sync disabled and machine is hybrid joined, it will auto-upgrade the on-premises profile to Azure AD profile and make it non-removable instead of creating a new non-removable Azure AD profile.</p>

<p>From Microsoft Edge 93 onwards, if policy <a href="#implicitsigninenabled">ImplicitSignInEnabled</a> is disabled, this policy will not take any effect.</p>
