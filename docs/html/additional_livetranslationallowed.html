<p>This is the on-device feature and none of the audio, data or even translated audio leave the device.</p>

<p>If you enable or don't configure this policy, users can turn this feature on or off in edge://settings/languages.
If you disable this policy, users will not be able to turn this feature on.

We recommend not to disable the policy, unless it is needed in your environment.</p>
