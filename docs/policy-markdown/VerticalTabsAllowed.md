# VerticalTabsAllowed

## Configures availability of a vertical layout for tabs on the side of the browser


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 88 or later

## Description

Configures whether a user can access an alternative layout where tabs are vertically aligned on the side of the browser instead of at the top.
When there are several tabs open, this layout provides better tab viewing and management. There's better visibility of the site titles,
it's easier to scan aligned icons, and there's more space to manage and close tabs.

If you disable this policy, then the vertical tab layout will not be available as an option for users.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the tab layout will still be at the top, but a user has the option to turn on vertical tabs on the side.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: Yes
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No
