# UserFeedbackAllowed

## Allow user feedback


## Supported versions

## Description

Microsoft Edge uses the Edge Feedback feature (enabled by default) to allow users to send feedback, suggestions or customer surveys and to report any issues with the browser. Also, by default, users can't disable (turn off) the Edge Feedback feature.

Starting in Microsoft Edge 105, if the user is signed into Microsoft Edge with their work or school account, their feedback is associated with their account and organization.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, users can invoke Edge Feedback.

If you disable this policy, users can't invoke Edge Feedback.
