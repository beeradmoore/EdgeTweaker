# InternetExplorerZoomDisplay

## Display zoom in IE Mode tabs with DPI Scale included like it is in Internet Explorer


## Supported versions

- On Windows since 103 or later

## Description

Lets you display zoom in IE Mode tabs similar to how it was displayed in Internet Explorer, where the DPI scale of the display is factored in.

For example, if you have a page zoomed to 200% on a 100 DPI scale display and you change the display to 150 DPI, Microsoft Edge would still display the zoom as 200%. However, Internet Explorer factors in the DPI scale and displays 300%.

If you enable this policy, zoom values will be displayed with the DPI scale included for IE Mode tabs.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, zoom values will be displayed without DPI scale included for IE Mode tabs
