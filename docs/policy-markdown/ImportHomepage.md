# ImportHomepage

## Allow importing of home page settings


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Allows users to import their home page setting from another browser into Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this policy, the option to manually import the home page setting is automatically selected.

If you disable this policy, the home page setting isn't imported at first run, and users can't import it manually.

If you don't configure this policy, the home page setting is imported at first run, and users can choose whether to import this data manually during later browsing sessions.

You can set this policy as a recommendation. This means that Microsoft Edge imports the home page setting on first run, but users can select or clear the **home page** option during manual import.

**Note**: This policy currently manages importing from Internet Explorer (on Windows 7, 8, and 10).
