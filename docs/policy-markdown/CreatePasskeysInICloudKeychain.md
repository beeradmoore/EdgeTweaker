# CreatePasskeysInICloudKeychain

## Control whether passkey creation will default to iCloud Keychain.


## Supported versions

- On macOS since 132 or later

## Description

Microsoft Edge may direct
passkey/WebAuthn creation requests directly to iCloud Keychain on macOS 13.5
or later. If iCloud Keychain syncing is not enabled yet, this will
prompt the user to sign in with iCloud, or might prompt them to enable iCloud
Keychain syncing.

If this policy is set to "true" then iCloud Keychain will be the default
whenever the WebAuthn request is compatible with that choice.

If this policy isn't set then the default behavior depends on factors such as
whether iCloud Drive is enabled, or whether the user has recently used or
created a credential in their
Microsoft Edge profile.

If this policy is set to false, iCloud Keychain will not be used by default
and the previous behavior (of creating the credential in the Microsoft Edge profile) may be used
instead. Users will still be able to select iCloud Keychain as an option, and
may still see iCloud Keychain credentials when signing in.
