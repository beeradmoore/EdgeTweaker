# TyposquattingAllowListDomains

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 121 or later

## Description

Configure the list of Edge Website Typo Protection trusted domains. This means:
Edge Website Typo Protection won't check for potentially malicious typosquatting websites.

If you enable this policy, Edge Website Typo Protection trusts these domains.
If you disable or don't set this policy, default Edge Website Typo Protection protection is applied to all resources.

This will only take effect when TyposquattingCheckerEnabled policy is not set or set to enabled.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.
