# LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled

## Enable default legacy SameSite cookie behavior setting (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 94.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 80, until 94

## Description

This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to serve only as a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their environments if they were found to be incompatible with the SameSite behavior change.

If you still require legacy cookie behavior, please use [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList](LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList.md) to configure behavior on a per-domain basis.

Lets you revert all cookies to legacy SameSite behavior. Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were "SameSite=None", removes the requirement for "SameSite=None" cookies to carry the "Secure" attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site.

If you don't set this policy, the default SameSite behavior for cookies will depend on other configuration sources for the SameSite-by-default feature, the Cookies-without-SameSite-must-be-secure feature, and the Schemeful Same-Site feature. These features can also be configured by a field trial or the same-site-by-default-cookies flag, the cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure flag, or the schemeful-same-site flag in edge://flags.

Policy options mapping:

* DefaultToLegacySameSiteCookieBehavior (1) = Revert to legacy SameSite behavior for cookies on all sites

* DefaultToSameSiteByDefaultCookieBehavior (2) = Use SameSite-by-default behavior for cookies on all sites

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.
