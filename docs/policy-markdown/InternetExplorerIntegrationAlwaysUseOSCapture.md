# InternetExplorerIntegrationAlwaysUseOSCapture

## Always use the OS capture engine to avoid issues with capturing Internet Explorer mode tabs


## Supported versions

- On Windows since 106 or later

## Description

Configure this policy to control whether Microsoft Edge will use the "OS capture engine" or the "Browser capture engine" when capturing browser windows in the same process using the screen-share APIs.

You should configure this policy if you want to capture the contents of Internet Explorer mode tabs. However, enabling this policy may negatively impact performance when capturing browser windows in the same process.

This policy only affects window capture, not tab capture. The contents of Internet Explorer mode tabs will not be captured when you choose to capture only a single tab, even if you configure this policy.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will always use the OS capture engine for window capture. Internet Explorer mode tabs will have their contents captured.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will use the Browser capture engine for browser windows in the same process. Internet Explorer mode tabs in these windows will not have their contents captured.

To learn more about Internet Explorer mode, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174004)
