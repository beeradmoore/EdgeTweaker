# ConfigureOnPremisesAccountAutoSignIn

## Configure automatic sign in with an Active Directory domain account when there is no Azure AD domain account


## Supported versions

- On Windows since 81 or later

## Description

Enable the use of Active Directory accounts for automatic sign in if your users' machines are Domain Joined and your environment is not hybrid joined. If you want users automatically signed in with their Azure Active Directory accounts instead, please Azure AD join (See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118197](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118197) for more information) or hybrid join (See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118365) for more information) your environment.

On every launch, Microsoft Edge will try to sign-in using this policy, as long as the first profile being launched isn't signed-in or an auto sign-in hasn't happened before.

If you have configured the [BrowserSignin](BrowserSignin.md) policy to disabled, this policy will not take any effect.

If you enable this policy and set it to 'SignInAndMakeDomainAccountNonRemovable', Microsoft Edge will automatically sign in users that are on domain joined machines using their Active Directory accounts.

If you set this policy to 'Disabled' or don't set it, Microsoft Edge will not automatically sign in users that are on domain joined machines with Active Directory accounts.

From Microsoft Edge 89 onwards, if there is an existing on-premises profile with [RoamingProfileSupportEnabled](RoamingProfileSupportEnabled.md) policy disabled and machine is now hybrid joined i.e it has an Azure AD account, it will auto-upgrade the on-premises profile to Azure AD profile to get full Azure AD sync facilities.

From Microsoft Edge 93 onwards, if policy [ImplicitSignInEnabled](ImplicitSignInEnabled.md) is disabled, this policy will not take any effect.

From Microsoft Edge 94 onwards, if policy [OnlyOnPremisesImplicitSigninEnabled](OnlyOnPremisesImplicitSigninEnabled.md) is enabled, and this policy is set to 'SignInAndMakeDomainAccountNonRemovable', it will take effect even on hybrid joined environment. Microsoft Edge will automatically sign in users using their Active Directory domain account even if there are MSA or AAD accounts.

* Disabled (0) = Disabled
