# AllowDeletingBrowserHistory

## Enable deleting browser and download history


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Enables deleting browser history and download history and prevents users from changing this setting.

Note that even with this policy is disabled, the browsing and download history aren't guaranteed to be retained: users can edit or delete the history database files directly, and the browser itself may remove (based on expiration period) or archive any or all history items at any time.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, users can delete the browsing and download history.

If you disable this policy, users can't delete browsing and download history. Disabling this policy will disable history sync and open tab sync.

If you enable this policy, don't enable the [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](ClearBrowsingDataOnExit.md) policy, because they both deal with deleting data. If you enable both, the [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](ClearBrowsingDataOnExit.md) policy takes precedence and deletes all data when Microsoft Edge closes, regardless of how this policy is configured.
