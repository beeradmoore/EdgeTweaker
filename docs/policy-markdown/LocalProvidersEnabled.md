# LocalProvidersEnabled

## Allow suggestions from local providers


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 83 or later

## Description

Allow suggestions from suggestion providers on the device (local providers), for example, Favorites and Browsing History, in Microsoft Edge's Address Bar and Auto-Suggest List.

If you enable this policy, suggestions from local providers are used.

If you disable this policy, suggestions from local providers are never used. Local history and local favorites suggestions will not appear.

If you do not configure this policy, suggestions from local providers are allowed but the user can change that using the settings toggle.

Note that some features may not be available if a policy to disable this feature has been applied. For example, Browsing History suggestions will not be available if you enable the [SavingBrowserHistoryDisabled](SavingBrowserHistoryDisabled.md) policy.

This policy requires a browser restart to finish applying.
