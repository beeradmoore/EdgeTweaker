# ImportAutofillFormData

## Allow importing of autofill form data


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Allows users to import autofill form data from another browser into Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this policy, the option to manually import autofill data is automatically selected.

If you disable this policy, autofill form data isn't imported at first run, and users can't import it manually.

If you don't configure this policy, autofill data is imported at first run, and users can choose whether to import this data manually during later browsing sessions.

You can set this policy as a recommendation. This means that Microsoft Edge will import autofill data on first run, but users can select or clear **autofill data** option during manual import.

**Note**: This policy currently manages importing from Google Chrome (on Windows 7, 8, and 10 and on macOS) and Mozilla Firefox (on Windows 7, 8, and 10 and on macOS) browsers.
