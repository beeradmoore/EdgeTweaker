# ImportPaymentInfo

## Allow importing of payment info


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Allows users to import payment info from another browser into Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this policy, the **payment info** check box is automatically selected in the **Import browser data** dialog box.

If you disable this policy, payment info isn't imported at first run, and users can't import it manually.

If you don't configure this policy, payment info is imported at first run, and users can choose whether to import it manually during later browsing sessions.

You can also set this policy as a recommendation. This means that Microsoft Edge imports payment info on first run, but users can select or clear the **payment info** option during manual import.

**Note:** This policy currently manages importing from Google Chrome (on Windows 7, 8, and 10 and on macOS).
