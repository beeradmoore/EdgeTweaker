# AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled

## Enable Microsoft Search in Bing suggestions in the address bar (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 136.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 81, until 136

## Description

Enables the display of relevant Microsoft Search in Bing suggestions in the address bar's suggestion list when the user enters a search query in the address bar. If you enable or don't configure this policy, users can see internal results powered by Microsoft Search in Bing in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion list. To access Microsoft Search in Bing results, the user must be signed into Microsoft Edge with their organization's Azure AD account.

If you disable this policy, users won't see internal results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion list.

Starting with Microsoft Edge version 89, Microsoft Search in Bing suggestions will be available even if Bing is not the user's default search provider.

This policy is no longer applicable due to changes in access to work search through Bing-related endpoints.
