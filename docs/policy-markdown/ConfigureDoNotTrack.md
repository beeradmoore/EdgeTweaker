# ConfigureDoNotTrack

## Configure Do Not Track


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Specify whether to send Do Not Track requests to websites that ask for tracking info. Do Not Track requests let the websites you visit know that you don't want your browsing activity to be tracked.

If you enable this policy, Do Not Track requests are always sent to websites asking for tracking info.

If you disable this policy, requests are never sent.

If you don't configure this policy, users can choose whether to send these requests.
