# JavaScriptBlockedForUrls

## Block JavaScript on specific sites


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Define a list of sites, based on URL patterns, that aren't allowed to run JavaScript.

If you don't configure this policy, [DefaultJavaScriptSetting](DefaultJavaScriptSetting.md) applies for all sites, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). Wildcards, *, are allowed.

Note that this policy blocks JavaScript based on whether the origin of the top-level document (usually the page URL that is also displayed in the address bar) matches any of the patterns. Therefore this policy is not appropriate for mitigating web supply-chain attacks. For example, supplying the pattern `https://[\*.]foo.com/` will not prevent a page hosted on, say, `https://contoso.com` from running a script loaded from `https://www.foo.com/example.js`. Furthermore, supplying the pattern `https://contoso.com/` will not prevent a document from `https://contoso.com` from running scripts if it is not the top-level document, but embedded as a sub-frame into a page hosted on another origin, say, `https://www.fabrikam.com`.
