# SaveCookiesOnExit

## Save cookies when Microsoft Edge closes


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 86 or later

## Description

When this policy is enabled, the specified set of cookies is exempt from deletion when the browser closes. This policy is only effective when:
- The 'Cookies and other site data' toggle is configured in Settings/Privacy and services/Clear browsing data on close or
- The policy [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](ClearBrowsingDataOnExit.md) is enabled or
- The policy [DefaultCookiesSetting](DefaultCookiesSetting.md) is set to 'Keep cookies for the duration of the session'.

You can define a list of sites, based on URL patterns, that will have their cookies preserved across sessions.

Note: Users can still edit the cookie site list to add or remove URLs. However, they can't remove URLs that have been added by an Admin.
