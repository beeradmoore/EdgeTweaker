# MicrosoftRootStoreEnabled

## Determines whether the Microsoft Root Store and built-in certificate verifier will be used to verify server certificates (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 114.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 109, until 114

## Description

When this policy is set to enabled, Microsoft Edge will perform verification of server certificates using the built-in certificate verifier with the Microsoft Root Store as the source of public trust.

When this policy is set to disabled, Microsoft Edge will use the system certificate verifier and system root certificates.

When this policy is not set, the Microsoft Root Store or system provided roots may be used.

This policy is planned to be removed in Microsoft Edge version
121 for Android devices when support for using the platform supplied roots is planned to be removed.

This policy was removed in Microsoft Edge version 115 for
Microsoft Windows and macOS,
Microsoft Edge version 120 for
Linux, and
Microsoft Edge version 121 for
Android
when support for using the platform supplied certificate verifier and roots was removed.
