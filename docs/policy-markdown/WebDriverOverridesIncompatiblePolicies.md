# WebDriverOverridesIncompatiblePolicies

## Allow WebDriver to Override Incompatible Policies (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 84.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77, until 84

## Description

This policy doesn't work because WebDriver is now compatible with all existing policies.

policies which can interfere with its operation.

Currently this policy disables [SitePerProcess](SitePerProcess.md) and [IsolateOrigins](IsolateOrigins.md) policies.

If the policy is enabled, WebDriver will be able to override incomaptible
policies.
If the policy is disabled or not configured, WebDriver will not be allowed
to override incompatible policies.
