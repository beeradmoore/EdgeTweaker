# GuidedSwitchEnabled

## Guided Switch Enabled


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 103 or later

## Description

Allows Microsoft Edge to prompt the user to switch to the appropriate profile when Microsoft Edge detects that a link is a personal or work link.

If you enable this policy, you'll be prompted to switch to another account if the current profile doesn't work for the requesting link.

If you disable this policy, you won't be prompted to switch to another account when there's a profile and link mismatch.

If this policy isn't configured, guided switch is turned on by default. A user can override this value in the browser settings.
