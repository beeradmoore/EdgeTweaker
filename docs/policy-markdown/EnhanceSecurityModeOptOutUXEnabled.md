# EnhanceSecurityModeOptOutUXEnabled

## Manage opt-out user experience for Enhanced Security Mode (ESM) in Microsoft Edge (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 135.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 115, until 135

## Description

This policy is obsolete because we have determined that this experimental opt-out UX is not required.

This policy lets you manage whether the opt-out user experience for enhanced security mode is presented when ESM is turned on for Microsoft Edge.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the UI for the opt-out user experience is on.

If you disable this policy, the UI for the opt-out user experience is off.

Note: If this policy is used, only the User Interface for the opt-out experience is supressed - ESM is still turned on. For more information, see the [EnhanceSecurityMode](EnhanceSecurityMode.md) policy.

For detailed information about Enhanced Security Mode, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185895](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185895).
