# WinHttpProxyResolverEnabled

## Use Windows proxy resolver


## Supported versions

- On Windows since 84 or later

## Description

This policy will be superseded by a similar feature in a future release. For more information, see https://crbug.com/1032820.

Use Windows to resolve proxies for all browser networking instead of the proxy resolver built into Microsoft Edge. The Windows proxy resolver enables Windows proxy features such as DirectAccess/NRPT.

This policy comes with the problems described by https://crbug.com/644030. It causes PAC files to be fetched and executed by Windows code, including PAC files set via the [ProxyPacUrl](ProxyPacUrl.md) policy. Since Network Fetches for the PAC file happen via Windows instead of Microsoft Edge code, network policies such as [DnsOverHttpsMode](DnsOverHttpsMode.md) will not apply to network fetches for a PAC file.

If you enable this policy, the Windows proxy resolver will be used.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the Microsoft Edge proxy resolver will be used.
