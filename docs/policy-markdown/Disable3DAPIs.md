# Disable3DAPIs

## Disable support for 3D graphics APIs


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Prevent web pages from accessing the graphics processing unit (GPU). Specifically, web pages can't access the WebGL API and plug-ins can't use the Pepper 3D API.

If you don't configure or disable this policy, it potentially allows web pages to use the WebGL API and plug-ins to use the Pepper 3D API. Microsoft Edge might, by default, still require command line arguments to be passed in order to use these APIs.

If [HardwareAccelerationModeEnabled](HardwareAccelerationModeEnabled.md) policy is set to false, the setting for 'Disable3DAPIs' policy is ignored - it's the equivalent of setting 'Disable3DAPIs' policy to true.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
- Per Profile: Yes
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No
