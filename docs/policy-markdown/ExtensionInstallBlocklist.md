# ExtensionInstallBlocklist

## Control which extensions cannot be installed


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Lets you specify which extensions the users CANNOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blocked, without a way for the user to enable them. After a disabled extension is removed from the blocklist it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blocklist value of '\*' means all extensions are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist.

If this policy isn't set, the user can install any extension in Microsoft Edge.

## Supported features
