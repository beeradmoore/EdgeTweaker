# DefaultPrinterSelection

## Default printer selection rules


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Overrides Microsoft Edge default printer selection rules. This policy determines the rules for selecting the default printer in Microsoft Edge, which happens the first time a user tries to print a page.

When this policy is set, Microsoft Edge tries to find a printer that matches all of the specified attributes and uses it as default printer. If there are multiple printers that meet the criteria, the first printer that matches is used.

If you don't configure this policy or no matching printers are found within the timeout, the printer defaults to the built-in PDF printer or no printer, if the PDF printer isn't available.

The value is parsed as a JSON object, conforming to the following schema: { "type": "object", "properties": { "idPattern": { "description": "Regular expression to match printer id.", "type": "string" }, "namePattern": { "description": "Regular expression to match printer display name.", "type": "string" } } }

Omitting a field means all values match; for example, if you don't specify connectivity Print Preview starts discovering all kinds of local printers. Regular expression patterns must follow the JavaScript RegExp syntax and matches are case sensitive.
