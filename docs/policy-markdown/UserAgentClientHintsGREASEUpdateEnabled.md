# UserAgentClientHintsGREASEUpdateEnabled

## Control the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 133.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 102, until 133

## Description

The User-Agent GREASE specification recommends the inclusion of additional GREASE characters beyond the current semicolon and space, and recommends that the arbitrary version number be varied over time.

When enabled, the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature aligns the User-Agent GREASE algorithm with the latest version from the specification.  The updated specification may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain. For more information, see the following specification: https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#grease

If this policy is enabled or not configured, the User-Agent GREASE algorithm from the specification will be used. If the policy is disabled, the prior User-Agent GREASE algorithm will be used.

This policy will be obsolete after version 133 because the updated GREASE algorithm has been on by default since Microsoft Edge version 102.
