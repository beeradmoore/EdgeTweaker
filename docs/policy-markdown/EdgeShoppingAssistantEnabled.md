# EdgeShoppingAssistantEnabled

## Shopping in Microsoft Edge Enabled


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 87 or later

## Description

This policy lets users compare the prices of a product they are looking at, get coupons or rebates from the website they're on, auto-apply coupons and help checkout faster using autofill data.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, shopping features such as price comparison, coupons, rebates and express checkout will be automatically applied for retail domains. Coupons for the current retailer and prices from other retailers will be fetched from a server.

If you disable this policy shopping features such as price comparison, coupons, rebates and express checkout will not be automatically found for retail domains.

Starting in version 90.0.818.56, the behavior of the messaging letting users know that there is a coupon, rebate, price comparison or price history available on shopping domains is also done through a horizontal banner below the address bar. Previously this messaging was done on the address bar.
