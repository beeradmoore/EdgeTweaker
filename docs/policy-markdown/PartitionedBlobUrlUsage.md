# PartitionedBlobUrlUsage

## Manage Blob URL Partitioning During Fetching and Navigation


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 135 or later

## Description

This policy controls whether Blob URLs are partitioned during fetching and navigation.
If this policy is set to Enabled or not set, Blob URLs will be partitioned.
If this policy is set to Disabled, Blob URLs won't be partitioned.  This is the Blob URL behavior prior to
Microsoft Edge version 135.

If storage partitioning is disabled for a given top-level origin by either
ThirdPartyStoragePartitioningBlockedForOrigins
or DefaultThirdPartyStoragePartitioningSetting,
then Blob URLs will also not be partitioned.

The policy is scheduled to be available through Microsoft Edge version 140. After this
version, the policy will be removed, and Microsoft Edge will no longer support unpartitioned
blob storage.

For detailed information on third-party storage partitioning, please see https://github.com/privacycg/storage-partitioning.
