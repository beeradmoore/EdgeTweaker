# RelaunchWindow

## Set the time interval for relaunch


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 93 or later

## Description

Specifies a target time window for the end of the relaunch notification period.

Users are notified of the need for a browser relaunch or device restart based on the [RelaunchNotification](RelaunchNotification.md) and [RelaunchNotificationPeriod](RelaunchNotificationPeriod.md) policy settings. Browsers and devices are forcibly restarted at the end of the notification period when the [RelaunchNotification](RelaunchNotification.md) policy is set to 'Required'. This RelaunchWindow policy can be used to defer the end of the notification period so that it falls within a specific time window.

If you don't configure this policy, the default target time window is the whole day (i.e., the end of the notification period is never deferred).

Note: Though the policy can accept multiple items in entries, all but the first item are ignored.
Warning: Setting this policy may delay application of software updates.
