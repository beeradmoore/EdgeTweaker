# AudioSandboxEnabled

## Allow the audio sandbox to run


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 81 or later

## Description

This policy controls the audio process sandbox.

If you enable this policy, the audio process will run sandboxed.

If you disable this policy, the audio process will run unsandboxed and the WebRTC audio-processing module will run in the renderer process.
This leaves users open to security risks related to running the audio subsystem unsandboxed.

If you don't configure this policy, the default configuration for the audio sandbox will be used, which might differ based on the platform.

This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the audio sandbox if they use security software setups that interfere with the sandbox.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
