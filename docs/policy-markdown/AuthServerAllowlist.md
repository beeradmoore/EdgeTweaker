# AuthServerAllowlist

## Configure list of allowed authentication servers


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Specifies which servers to enable for integrated authentication. Integrated authentication is only enabled when Microsoft Edge receives an authentication challenge from a proxy or from a server in this list.

Separate multiple server names with commas. Wildcards (*) are allowed.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge tries to detect if a server is on the intranet - only then will it respond to IWA requests. If the server is on the internet, IWA requests from it are ignored by Microsoft Edge.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
