# ForceLegacyDefaultReferrerPolicy

## Use a default referrer policy of no-referrer-when-downgrade (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 88.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 81, until 88

## Description

This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their web content if it was found to be incompatible with the new default referrer policy.

Microsoft Edge's default referrer policy was strengthened from the value of no-referrer-when-downgrade to the more secure strict-origin-when-cross-origin.

When this enterprise policy is enabled, Microsoft Edge's default referrer policy will be set to its old value of no-referrer-when-downgrade.

This enterprise policy is disabled by default.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes

## Data type

- Boolean
