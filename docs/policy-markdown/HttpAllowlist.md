# HttpAllowlist

## HTTP Allowlist


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 123 or later

## Description

Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames or hostname patterns (such as '[\*.]example.com') that will not be upgraded to HTTPS. Organizations can use this policy to maintain access to servers that do not support HTTPS, without needing to disable [AutomaticHttpsDefault](AutomaticHttpsDefault.md) or [HttpsUpgradesEnabled](HttpsUpgradesEnabled.md).

Supplied hostnames must be canonicalized: Any IDNs must be converted to their A-label format, and all ASCII letters must be lowercase.

Blanket host wildcards (i.e., "*" or "[*]") are not allowed. Instead, HTTPS-First Mode and HTTPS Upgrades should be explicitly disabled via their specific policies.

Note: This policy does not apply to HSTS upgrades.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
- Per Profile: Yes
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
