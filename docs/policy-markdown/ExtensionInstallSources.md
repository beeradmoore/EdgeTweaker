# ExtensionInstallSources

## Configure extension and user script install sources


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Define URLs that can install extensions and themes.

Define URLs that can install extensions and themes directly without having to drag and drop the packages to the edge://extensions page.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095039](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095039)). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (in other words, the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns. Do not host the files at a location that requires authentication.

The [ExtensionInstallBlocklist](ExtensionInstallBlocklist.md) policy takes precedence over this policy. Any extensions that's on the block list won't be installed, even if it comes from a site on this list.
