# ComponentUpdatesEnabled

## Enable component updates in Microsoft Edge


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

If you enable or don't configure this policy, component updates are enabled in Microsoft Edge.

If you disable this policy or set it to false, component updates are disabled for all components in Microsoft Edge.

However, some components are exempt from this policy. This includes any component that doesn't contain executable code, that doesn't significantly alter the behavior of the browser, or that's critical for security. That is, updates that are deemed "critical for security" are still applied even if you disable this policy.

Examples of such components include the certificate revocation lists and security lists like tracking prevention lists.

Please note that disabling this policy can potentially prevent the Microsoft Edge developers from providing critical security fixes in a timely manner and is thus not recommended.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
