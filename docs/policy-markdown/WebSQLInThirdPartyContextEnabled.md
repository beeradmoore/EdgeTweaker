# WebSQLInThirdPartyContextEnabled

## Force WebSQL in third-party contexts to be re-enabled (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 100.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 97, until 100

## Description

This policy is obsolete because it was intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their web content when it's found to be incompatible with the change to disable WebSQL in third-party contexts. It doesn't work in Microsoft Edge after version 100.

WebSQL in third-party contexts (for example, cross-site iframes) is off by default as of Microsoft Edge version 97 and was fully removed in version 101.

If you enable this policy, WebSQL in third-party contexts will be re-enabled.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, WebSQL in third-party contexts will stay off.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
