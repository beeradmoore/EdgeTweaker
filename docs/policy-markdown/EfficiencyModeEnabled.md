# EfficiencyModeEnabled

## Efficiency mode enabled


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 106 or later

## Description

Enables efficiency mode which helps extend battery life by saving computer resources. By default, efficiency mode is enabled for devices with a battery and disabled otherwise.

If you enable this policy, efficiency mode will become active according to the setting chosen by the user. You can configure the efficiency mode setting using the [EfficiencyMode](EfficiencyMode.md) policy. If the device does not have a battery, efficiency mode will always be active.

If you disable this policy, efficiency mode will never become active. The [EfficiencyMode](EfficiencyMode.md) and [EfficiencyModeOnPowerEnabled](EfficiencyModeOnPowerEnabled.md) policies will have no effect.

If you don't configure this policy, efficiency mode will be enabled for devices with a battery and disabled otherwise. Users can choose the efficiency mode option they want in edge://settings/system.
