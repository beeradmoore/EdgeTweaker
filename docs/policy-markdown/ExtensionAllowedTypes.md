# ExtensionAllowedTypes

## Configure allowed extension types


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Setting the policy controls which apps and extensions may be installed in Microsoft Edge, which hosts they can interact with, and limits runtime access.

If you don't set this policy, there aren't any restrictions on acceptable extension and app types.

Extensions and apps which have a type that's not on the list won't be installed. Each value should be one of these strings:

* "extension"

* "theme"

* "user_script"

* "hosted_app"

See the Microsoft Edge extensions documentation for more information about these types.

Note: This policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed using [ExtensionInstallForcelist](ExtensionInstallForcelist.md).

Policy options mapping:

* extension (extension) = Extension

* theme (theme) = Theme

* user_script (user_script) = User script

* hosted_app (hosted_app) = Hosted app

* legacy_packaged_app (legacy_packaged_app) = Legacy packaged app

* platform_app (platform_app) = Platform app

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.
