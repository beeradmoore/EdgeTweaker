# WebContentFilteringBlockedCategories

## Configure Web Content Filtering


## Supported versions

- On Windows since 135 or later

## Description

Configure this policy to block access to specific categories of websites in Microsoft Edge on Windows devices. Web Content Filtering is available exclusively in Microsoft Edge on Windows and requires the appropriate Microsoft 365 licensing.

When this policy is enabled, users are blocked from accessing URLs that fall within the defined list of content categories. You can configure this by adding Category Strings to the list of blocked categories.

If the policy is not configured or is disabled, no categories will be blocked.

To view the list of supported content categories, including each Category String and its definition, refer to: [Web content filtering](/defender-endpoint/web-content-filtering)

To block a specific URL outside of a category, use the “Block access to a list of URLs” policy.

To allow a specific URL that falls under a blocked category, use the “Define a list of allowed URLs” policy.
