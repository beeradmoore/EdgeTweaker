# DefinePreferredLanguages

## Define an ordered list of preferred languages that websites should display in if the site supports the language


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 89 or later

## Description

Configures the language variants that Microsoft Edge sends to websites as part of the Accept-Language request HTTP header and prevents users from adding, removing, or changing the order of preferred languages in Microsoft Edge settings. Users who want to change the languages Microsoft Edge displays in or offers to translate pages to will be limited to the languages configured in this policy.

If you enable this policy, websites will appear in the first language in the list that they support unless other site-specific logic is used to determine the display language. The language variants defined in this policy override the languages configured as part of the [SpellcheckLanguage](SpellcheckLanguage.md) policy.

If you don't configure or disable this policy, Microsoft Edge sends websites the user-specified preferred languages as part of the Accept-Language request HTTP header.

For detailed information on valid language variants, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148854](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148854).
