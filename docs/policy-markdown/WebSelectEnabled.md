# WebSelectEnabled

## Web Select Enabled (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 116.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 107, until 116

## Description

This policy is obsoleted because Web Select is part of Web Capture and can be controlled by [WebCaptureEnabled](WebCaptureEnabled.md). This policy won't work in Microsoft Edge version 117. If Web Capture is disabled by [WebCaptureEnabled](WebCaptureEnabled.md), Web select will not be available in Web Capture.

Web select lets users select and copy web content while preserving its formatting when pasted in most cases. It also allows more targeted selection on some web elements, such as copying a single column in a table.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, Web select is available in Web Capture and can be accessed directly using the CTRL+SHIFT+X keyboard shortcut.

If you disable this policy, Web select will not be available in Web Capture and the CTRL+SHIFT+X keyboard shortcut will also not work.
