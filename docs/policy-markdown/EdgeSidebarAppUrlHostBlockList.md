# EdgeSidebarAppUrlHostBlockList

## Control which apps cannot be opened in Microsoft Edge sidebar


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 127 or later

## Description

Define a list of sites, based on URL patterns, that cannot be opened in sidebar.

If you don't configure this policy, a user can open any app in sidebar.

If the [HubsSidebarEnabled](HubsSidebarEnabled.md) policy is disabled, this list isn't used and no sidebar can be opened.

For detailed information about valid url patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2281313](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2281313).

Note: A blocklist value of '\*' means all apps are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the [EdgeSidebarAppUrlHostAllowList](EdgeSidebarAppUrlHostAllowList.md) policy.
