# RunAllFlashInAllowMode

## Extend Adobe Flash content setting to all content (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 88.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77, until 88

## Description

This policy doesn't work because Flash is no longer supported by Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this policy, all Adobe Flash content embedded in websites that are set to allow Adobe Flash in the content settings -- either by the user or by enterprise policy -- will run. This includes content from other origins and/or small content.

To control which websites are allowed to run Adobe Flash, see the specifications in the [DefaultPluginsSetting](DefaultPluginsSetting.md), [PluginsAllowedForUrls](PluginsAllowedForUrls.md), and [PluginsBlockedForUrls](PluginsBlockedForUrls.md) policies.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, Adobe Flash content from other origins (from sites that aren't specified in the three policies mentioned immediately above) or small content might be blocked.
