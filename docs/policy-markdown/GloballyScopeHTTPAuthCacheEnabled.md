# GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled

## Enable globally scoped HTTP auth cache


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 81 or later

## Description

This policy configures a single global per profile cache with HTTP server authentication credentials.

If you disable or don't set this policy, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site. So, if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If you enable this policy HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another site.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures and will be removed in the future.
