# ExtensionExtendedBackgroundLifetimeForPortConnectionsToUrls

## Configure a list of origins that grant an extended background lifetime to connecting extensions.


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 128 or later

## Description

Extensions that connect to one of these origins will keep running as long as the port is connected.
If unset, the policy's default values are used. These are the app origins that offer SDKs that are known to not offer the possibility to restart a closed connection to a previous state:
- Smart Card Connector
- Citrix Receiver (stable, beta, back-up)
- VMware Horizon (stable, beta)

If set, the default value list is extended with the newly configured values. The defaults and policy-provided entries will grant the exception to the connecting extensions, as long as the port is connected.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
- Per Profile: Yes
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No

## Data type

- List of strings
