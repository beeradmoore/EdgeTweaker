# NativeHostsExecutablesLaunchDirectly

## Force Windows executable Native Messaging hosts to launch directly


## Supported versions

- On Windows since 121 or later

## Description

This policy controls whether native host executables launch directly on Windows.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge is forced to launch native messaging hosts implemented as executables directly.

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will launch hosts using cmd.exe as an intermediary process.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will decide which approach to use based on a progressive rollout from the legacy behavior to the Launch Directly behavior, guided by ecosystem compatibility.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: Yes
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No
