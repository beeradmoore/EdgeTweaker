# AutofillAddressEnabled

## Enable AutoFill for addresses


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Enables the AutoFill feature and allows users to auto-complete address information in web forms using previously stored information.

If this policy is enabled or not configured, users can manage AutoFill for addresses in Microsoft Edge settings. AutoFill allows users to complete address fields in web forms using previously saved information.

If this policy is disabled, Microsoft Edge does not suggest, fill in, or save address information. AutoFill is also disabled for all web forms except payment and password fields, and previously saved addresses are not available.

Disabling this policy also turns off [EdgeAutofillMlEnabled](EdgeAutofillMlEnabled.md).

Note that if you disable this policy you also stop all activity for all web forms, except payment and password forms. No further entries are saved, and Microsoft Edge won't suggest or AutoFill any previous entries.
