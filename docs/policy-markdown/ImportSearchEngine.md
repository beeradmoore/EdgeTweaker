# ImportSearchEngine

## Allow importing of search engine settings


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Allows users to import search engine settings from another browser into Microsoft Edge.

If you enable, this policy, the option to import search engine settings is automatically selected.

If you disable this policy, search engine settings aren't imported at first run, and users can't import them manually.

If you don't configure this policy, search engine settings are imported at first run, and users can choose whether to import this data manually during later browsing sessions.

You can set this policy as a recommendation. This means that Microsoft Edge imports search engine settings on first run, but users can select or clear the **search engine** option during manual import.

**Note**: This policy currently manages importing from Internet Explorer (on Windows 7, 8, and 10).
