# CommandLineFlagSecurityWarningsEnabled

## Enable security warnings for command-line flags


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 78 or later

## Description

If disabled, this policy prevents security warnings from appearing when Microsoft Edge is launched with potentially dangerous command-line flags.

If enabled or unset, security warnings are displayed when these command-line flags are used to launch Microsoft Edge.

For example, the --disable-gpu-sandbox flag generates this warning:  You're using an unsupported command-line flag: --disable-gpu-sandbox. This poses stability and security risks.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, joined to Microsoft Azure Active Directory, or instances that enrolled for device management. On macOS, this policy is available only on instances that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

- Can be mandatory: Yes

- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
