# DownloadDirectory

## Set download directory


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Configures the directory to use when downloading files.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the provided directory regardless of whether the user has specified one or chosen to be prompted for download location every time. See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041) for a list of variables that can be used.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the default download directory is used, and the user can change it.

If you set an invalid path, Microsoft Edge will default to the user's default download directory.

If the folder specified by the path doesn't exist, the download will trigger a prompt that asks the user where they want to save their download.
