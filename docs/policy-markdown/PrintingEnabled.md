# PrintingEnabled

## Enable printing


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Enables printing in Microsoft Edge and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, users can print.

If you disable this policy, users can't print from Microsoft Edge. Printing is disabled in the wrench menu, extensions, JavaScript applications, and so on. Users can still print from plug-ins that bypass Microsoft Edge while printing. For example, certain Adobe Flash applications have the print option in their context menu, which isn't covered by this policy.
