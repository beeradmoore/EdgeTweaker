# WebAuthenticationRemoteDesktopAllowedOrigins

## Allowed Origins for Proxied WebAuthn Requests from Remote Desktop Applications.


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 137 or later

## Description

This policy defines a list of allowed HTTPS origins for remote desktop client applications that initiate WebAuthn API requests from a browsing session on a remote host.

Origins specified in this policy can request WebAuthn authentication for Relying Party IDs (RP IDs) they would not typically be authorized to claim.

Only HTTPS origins are supported. Wildcards are not permitted. Entries that do not
meet these requirements will be ignored.
