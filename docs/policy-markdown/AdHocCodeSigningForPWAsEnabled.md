# AdHocCodeSigningForPWAsEnabled

## Native application signing during Progressive Web Application installation


## Supported versions

- On macOS since 132 or later

## Description

Enabling this policy or leaving it unset enables the use of ad-hoc signatures for the native application that's created when installing a Progressive Web Application (PWA). This ensures that each installed application has a unique identity to macOS system components.

Disabling this policy will result in every native application created when installing Progressive Web Applications having the same identity. This can interfere with macOS functionality.

Only turn off the policy if you are using an endpoint security solution that blocks applications with an ad-hoc signature.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes

## Data type

- Boolean

## Mac information and settings

- Preference Key name: AdHocCodeSigningForPWAsEnabled
- Example value:

```xml
<false/>
```
