# WebHidAllowDevicesWithHidUsagesForUrls

## Automatically grant permission to these sites to connect to HID devices containing top-level collections with the given HID usage


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 109 or later

## Description

This setting allows you to list the URLs that specify which sites are automatically granted permission to access a HID device containing a top-level collection with the given HID usage.

Each item in the list requires both usages and urls fields for the policy to be valid.

  * Each item in the usages field must have a usage_page and may have a usage field.

  * Omitting the usage field will create a policy matching any device containing a top-level collection with a usage from the specified usage page.

  * An item which has a usage field without a usage_page field is invalid and is ignored.

If you don't set this policy, that means [DefaultWebHidGuardSetting](DefaultWebHidGuardSetting.md) applies, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

For detailed information about valid url patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

URLs in this policy shouldn't conflict with those configured through [WebHidBlockedForUrls](WebHidBlockedForUrls.md). If they do, this policy takes precedence over [WebHidBlockedForUrls](WebHidBlockedForUrls.md).
