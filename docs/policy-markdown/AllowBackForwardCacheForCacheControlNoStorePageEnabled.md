# AllowBackForwardCacheForCacheControlNoStorePageEnabled

## Allow pages with Cache-Control: no-store header to enter back/forward cache


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 123 or later

## Description

This policy controls if a page with Cache-Control: no-store header can be stored in back/forward cache. The website setting this header may not expect the page to be restored from back/forward cache since some sensitive information could still be displayed after the restoration even if it is no longer accessible.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the page with Cache-Control: no-store header might be restored from back/forward cache unless the cache eviction is triggered (e.g. when there is HTTP-only cookie change to the site).

If you disable this policy, the page with Cache-Control: no-store header will not be stored in back/forward cache.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
- Per Profile: Yes
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No
