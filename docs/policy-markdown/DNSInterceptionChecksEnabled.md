# DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled

## DNS interception checks enabled


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 80 or later

## Description

This policy configures a local switch that can be used to disable DNS interception checks. These checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

This detection might not be necessary in an enterprise environment where the network configuration is known. It can be disabled to avoid additional DNS and HTTP traffic on start-up and each DNS configuration change.

If you enable or don't set this policy, the DNS interception checks are performed.

If you disable this policy, DNS interception checks aren't performed.
