> DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

This policy is deprecated, use [ProxySettings](ProxySettings.md) instead. It won't work in Microsoft Edge version 91.

This policy is applied only if the [ProxySettings](ProxySettings.md) policy isn't specified and you have selected fixed_servers in the [ProxyMode](ProxyMode.md) policy. If you selected any other mode for configuring proxy policies, don't enable or configure this policy.

If you enable this policy, the proxy server configured by this policy will be used for all URLs.
