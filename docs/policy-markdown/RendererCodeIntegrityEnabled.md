# RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled

## Enable renderer code integrity (deprecated)
> DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.

## Supported versions

- On Windows since 78 or later

## Description

Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset turns Renderer Code Integrity on.
Setting the policy to Disabled has a detrimental effect on Microsoft Edge's security and stability as unknown and potentially hostile code can load inside Microsoft Edge's renderer processes. Only turn off the policy if there are compatibility issues with third-party software that must run inside Microsoft Edge's renderer processes.

This policy will be removed in Edge 119 and will be ignored if set.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes

## Data type

- Boolean
