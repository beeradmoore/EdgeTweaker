# TabServicesEnabled

## Enable tab organization suggestions


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 113 or later

## Description

This policy controls whether Microsoft Edge can use its tab organization service to help name or suggest tab groups to increase productivity.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, when a user creates a tab group or activates certain "Group Similar Tabs" features Microsoft Edge sends tab data to its tab organization service. This data includes URLs, page titles, and existing group information. The service uses this data to return suggestions for better groupings and group names.

If you disable this policy, no data will be sent to the tab organization service. Microsoft Edge won't suggest group names when a group is created and certain "Group Similar Tabs" features that rely on the service won't be available.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
- Per Profile: Yes
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No
