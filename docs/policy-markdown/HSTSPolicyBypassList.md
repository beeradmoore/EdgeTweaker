# HSTSPolicyBypassList

## Configure the list of names that will bypass the HSTS policy check


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 79 or later

## Description

Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames that bypass preloaded HSTS upgrades from http to https.

Only single-label hostnames are allowed in this policy, and this policy only applies to static HSTS-preloaded entries (for example, "app", "new", "search", "play"). This policy does not prevent HSTS upgrades for servers that have dynamically requested HSTS upgrades using a Strict-Transport-Security response header.

Supplied hostnames must be canonicalized: Any IDNs must be converted to their A-label format, and all ASCII letters must be lowercase. This policy only applies to the specific single-label hostnames specified, not to subdomains of those names.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: Yes
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
