# CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls

## Limit cookies from specific websites to the current session


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Cookies created by websites that match a URL pattern you define are deleted when the session ends (when the window closes).

Cookies created by websites that don't match the pattern are controlled by the [DefaultCookiesSetting](DefaultCookiesSetting.md) policy (if set) or by the user's personal configuration. This is also the default behavior if you don't configure this policy.

You can also use the [CookiesAllowedForUrls](CookiesAllowedForUrls.md) and [CookiesBlockedForUrls](CookiesBlockedForUrls.md) policies to control which websites can create cookies.

Note there cannot be conflicting URL patterns set between these three policies:

- [CookiesBlockedForUrls](CookiesBlockedForUrls.md)

- [CookiesAllowedForUrls](CookiesAllowedForUrls.md)

- CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls

For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

If you set the [RestoreOnStartup](RestoreOnStartup.md) policy to restore URLs from previous sessions, this policy is ignored, and cookies are stored permanently for those sites.

## Supported features
