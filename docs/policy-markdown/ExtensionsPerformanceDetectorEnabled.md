# ExtensionsPerformanceDetectorEnabled

## Extensions Performance Detector enabled


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 130 or later

## Description

This policy controls if users can access the Extensions Performance Detector Recommended Action feature in Browser Essentials. This feature alerts extension users if their extensions are causing performance regressions in the browser and allows them to take action to resolve the issue.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, users will receive Extensions Performance Detector notifications from Browser Essentials. When there is an active alert, users will be able to view the impact of extensions on their browser's performance and make an informed decision to disable impacting extensions. The detector will exclude browser-managed extensions, such as Google Docs offline, component extensions, and organization-managed extensions (ie. extensions that cannot be disabled).

If you disable this policy, users will not receive notifications or be able to view the Extensions Performance Detector Recommended Action.
