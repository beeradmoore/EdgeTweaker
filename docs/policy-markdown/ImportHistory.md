# ImportHistory

## Allow importing of browsing history


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Allows users to import their browsing history from another browser into Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this policy, the **Browsing history** check box is automatically selected in the **Import browser data** dialog box.

If you disable this policy, browsing history data isn't imported at first run, and users can't import this data manually.

If you don't configure this policy, browsing history data is imported at first run, and users can choose whether to import it manually during later browsing sessions.

You can also set this policy as a recommendation. This means that Microsoft Edge imports browsing history on first run, but users can select or clear the **history** option during manual import.

**Note**: This policy currently manages importing from Internet Explorer (on Windows 7, 8, and 10), Google Chrome (on Windows 7, 8, and 10 and on macOS), Mozilla Firefox (on Windows 7, 8, and 10 and on macOS), and Apple Safari (macOS) browsers.
