# MaxConnectionsPerProxy

## Maximum number of concurrent connections to the proxy server


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the proxy server.

Some proxy servers can't handle a high number of concurrent connections per client - you can solve this by setting this policy to a lower value.

The value of this policy should be lower than 100 and higher than 6. The default value is 32.

Some web apps are known to consume many connections with hanging GETs - lowering the maximum connections below 32 may lead to browser networking hangs if too many of these kind of web apps are open.

If you don't configure this policy, the default value (32) is used.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
