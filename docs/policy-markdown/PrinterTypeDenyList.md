# PrinterTypeDenyList

## Disable printer types on the deny list


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 88 or later

## Description

The printer types on the deny list won't be discovered or have their capabilities fetched.

Placing all printer types on the deny list effectively disables printing, because there's no print destination for documents.

If you don't configure this policy, or the printer list is empty, all printer types are discoverable.

Printer destinations include extension printers and local printers. Extension printers are also known as print provider destinations, and include any destination that belongs to a Microsoft Edge extension.
Local printers are also known as native printing destinations, and include destinations available to the local machine and shared network printers.

In Microsoft version 93 or later, if you set this policy to 'pdf' it also disables the 'save as Pdf' option from the right click context menu.

In Microsoft version 103 or later, if you set this policy to 'onedrive' it also disables the 'save as Pdf (OneDrive)' option from print preview.

Policy options mapping:

* privet (privet) = Zeroconf-based (mDNS + DNS-SD) protocol destinations

* extension (extension) = Extension-based destinations

* pdf (pdf) = The 'Save as PDF' destination. (93 or later, also disables from context menu)

* local (local) = Local printer destinations

* onedrive (onedrive) = Save as PDF (OneDrive) printer destinations. (103 or later)

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.
