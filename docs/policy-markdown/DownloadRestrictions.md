# DownloadRestrictions

## Allow download restrictions


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Configures the type of downloads that Microsoft Edge completely blocks, without letting users override the security decision.

Set 'BlockDangerousDownloads' to allow all downloads except for those that carry Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings of known dangerous downloads or that have dangerous file type extensions.

Set 'BlockPotentiallyDangerousDownloads' to allow all downloads except for those that carry Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings of potentially dangerous or unwanted downloads or that have dangerous file type extensions.

Set 'BlockAllDownloads' to block all downloads.

Set 'BlockMaliciousDownloads' to allow all downloads except for those that carry Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings of known malicious downloads.

If you don't configure this policy or set the 'DefaultDownloadSecurity' option, the downloads go through the usual security restrictions based on Microsoft Defender SmartScreen analysis results.

Note that these restrictions apply to downloads from web page content, as well as the 'download link...' context menu option. These restrictions don't apply to saving or downloading the currently displayed page, nor do they apply to the Save as PDF option from the printing options.

See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2094934](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2094934) for more info on Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.
