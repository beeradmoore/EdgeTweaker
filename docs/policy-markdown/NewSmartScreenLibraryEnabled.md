# NewSmartScreenLibraryEnabled

## Enable new SmartScreen library (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 107.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 95, until 107

## Description

This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to support the update to a new SmartScreen client.

Allows the Microsoft Edge browser to load the new SmartScreen library (libSmartScreenN) for any SmartScreen checks on site URLs or application downloads.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will use the new SmartScreen library (libSmartScreenN).

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will use the old SmartScreen library (libSmartScreen).

Before Microsoft Edge version 103, if you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will use the old SmartScreen library (libSmartScreen).
