# TripleDESEnabled

## Enable 3DES cipher suites in TLS (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 96.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 93, until 96

## Description

'This policy was removed in version 97 after 3DES was removed from Microsoft Edge.

If the policy is set to true, then 3DES cipher suites in TLS will be enabled. If it is set to false, they will be disabled. If the policy is unset, 3DES cipher suites are disabled by default. This policy may be used to temporarily retain compatibility with an outdated server. This is a stopgap measure and the server should be reconfigured.

## Supported features

- Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes

## Data type
