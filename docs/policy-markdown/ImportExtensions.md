# ImportExtensions

## Allow importing of extensions


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 81 or later

## Description

Allows users to import extensions from another browser into Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this policy, the **Extensions** check box is automatically selected in the **Import browser data** dialog box.

If you disable this policy, extensions aren't imported at first run, and users can't import them manually.

If you don't configure this policy, extensions are imported at first run, and users can choose whether to import them manually during later browsing sessions.

You can also set this policy as a recommendation. This means that Microsoft Edge imports extensions on first run, but users can select or clear the **extensions** option during manual import.

**Note**: This policy currently only supports importing from Google Chrome (on Windows 7, 8, and 10 and on macOS).
