# BlockTruncatedCookies

## Block truncated cookies (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 131.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 123, until 131

## Description

This policy provides a temporary opt-out for changes to how Microsoft Edge handles cookies set via JavaScript that contain certain control characters (NULL, carriage return, and line feed).
Previously, the presence of any of these characters in a cookie string would cause it to be truncated but still set.
Now, the presence of these characters will cause the whole cookie string to be ignored.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the new behavior is enabled.

If you disable this policy, the old behavior is enabled.

This policy is obsolete because this policy was originally implemented as a safety measure in case of breakage, but none have been reported.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No

- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No
