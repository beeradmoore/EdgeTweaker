# AddressBarEditingEnabled

## Configure address bar editing


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 98 or later

## Description

If you enable or don't configure this policy, users can change the URL in the address bar.

If you disable this policy, it prevents users from changing the URL in the address bar.

- [NewTabPageLocation](NewTabPageLocation.md)

- [HomepageLocation](HomepageLocation.md)

- [HomepageIsNewTabPage](HomepageIsNewTabPage.md)
