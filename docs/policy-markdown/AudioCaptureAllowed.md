# AudioCaptureAllowed

## Allow or block audio capture


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Allows you to set whether a user is prompted to grant a website access to their audio capture device. This policy applies to all URLs except for those configured in the [AudioCaptureAllowedUrls](AudioCaptureAllowedUrls.md) list.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it (the default setting), the user is prompted for audio capture access except from the URLs in the [AudioCaptureAllowedUrls](AudioCaptureAllowedUrls.md) list. These listed URLs are granted access without prompting.

If you disable this policy, the user is not prompted, and audio capture is accessible only to the URLs configured in [AudioCaptureAllowedUrls](AudioCaptureAllowedUrls.md).

This policy affects all types of audio inputs, not only the built-in microphone.
