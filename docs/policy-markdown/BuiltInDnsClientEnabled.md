# BuiltInDnsClientEnabled

## Use built-in DNS client


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Controls whether to use the built-in DNS client.

This policy controls which software stack is used to communicate with the DNS server: the operating system DNS client, or Microsoft Edge's built-in DNS client. This policy does not affect which DNS servers are used: if, for example, the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It also does not control if DNS-over-HTTPS is used; Microsoft Edge always uses the built-in resolver for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. Please see the [DnsOverHttpsMode](DnsOverHttpsMode.md) policy for information on controlling DNS-over-HTTPS.

If you enable this policy or you don't configure this policy, the built-in DNS client is used.

If you disable this policy, the built-in DNS client is only used when DNS-over-HTTPS is in use.
