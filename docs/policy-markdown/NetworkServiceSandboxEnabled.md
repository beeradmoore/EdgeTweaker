# NetworkServiceSandboxEnabled

## Enable the network service sandbox


## Supported versions

- On Windows since 102 or later

## Description

This policy controls whether or not the network service process runs sandboxed.
If this policy is enabled, the network service process will run sandboxed.
If this policy is disabled, the network service process will run unsandboxed. This leaves users open to additional security risks related to running the network service unsandboxed.
If this policy is not set, the default configuration for the network sandbox will be used. This may vary depending on Microsoft Edge release, currently running field trials, and platform.
This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the network sandbox if they use third party software that interferes with the network service sandbox.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
