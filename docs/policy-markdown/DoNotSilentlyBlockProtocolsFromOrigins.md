# DoNotSilentlyBlockProtocolsFromOrigins

## Define a list of protocols that can not be silently blocked by anti-flood protection


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 99 or later

## Description

Allows you to create a list of protocols, and for each protocol an associated list of allowed origin patterns. These origins won't be silently blocked from launching an external application by anti-flood protection. The trailing separator shouldn't be included when listing the protocol. For example, list "skype" instead of "skype:" or "skype://".

If you configure this policy, a protocol will only be permitted to bypass being silently blocked by anti-flood protection if:

- the protocol is listed

- the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list.

If either condition is false, the external protocol launch may be blocked by anti-flood protection.

If you don't configure this policy, no protocols can bypass being silently blocked.

The origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the [URLBlocklist](URLBlocklist.md) policy, that are documented at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).

However, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain "/path" or "@query" elements. Any pattern that does contain a "/path" or "@query" element will be ignored.

This policy doesn't work as expected with file://* wildcards.

## Supported features
