# WebHidAskForUrls

## Allow the WebHID API on these sites


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 100 or later

## Description

Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites can ask users to grant them access to a HID device.

Leaving the policy unset means [DefaultWebHidGuardSetting](DefaultWebHidGuardSetting.md) applies for all sites, if it's set. If not, users' personal settings apply.

For URL patterns that don't match the policy, the following values are applied in order of precedence:

  * [WebHidBlockedForUrls](WebHidBlockedForUrls.md) (if there is a match),

  * [DefaultWebHidGuardSetting](DefaultWebHidGuardSetting.md) (if set), or

  * Users' personal settings.

URL patterns must not conflict with [WebHidBlockedForUrls](WebHidBlockedForUrls.md). Neither policy takes precedence if a URL matches both patterns.

For detailed information about valid url patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.
