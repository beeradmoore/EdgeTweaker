# FetchKeepaliveDurationSecondsOnShutdown

## Fetch keepalive duration on shutdown


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 90 or later

## Description

Controls the duration (in seconds) that keepalive requests are allowed to prevent the browser from completing its shutdown.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the default value of 0 seconds is used and outstanding keepalive requests will be immediately cancelled during browser shutdown.
