# HomepageIsNewTabPage

## Set the new tab page as the home page


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Configures the default home page in Microsoft Edge. You can set the home page to a URL you specify or to the new tab page.

If you enable this policy, the Home button is set to the new tab page as configured by the user or with the policy [NewTabPageLocation](NewTabPageLocation.md) and the URL set with the policy [HomepageLocation](HomepageLocation.md) is not taken into consideration.

If you disable this policy, the Home button is the set URL as configured by the user or as configured in the policy [HomepageLocation](HomepageLocation.md).

If you don't configure this policy, users can choose whether the set URL or the new tab page is their home page.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, joined to Microsoft Azure Active Directory, or instances that enrolled for device management.
