# CookiesAllowedForUrls

## Allow cookies on specific sites


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Define a list of sites, based on URL patterns, that are allowed to set cookies. URL patterns may be a single URL indicating that the site may use cookies on all top-level sites. Patterns may also be two URLs delimited by a comma. The first specifies the site that should be allowed to use cookies. The second specifies the top-level site that the first value should be applied on. If you use a pair of URLs, the first value in the pair supports * but the second value does not. Using * for the first value indicates that all sites may use cookies when the second URL is the top-level site.

If you don't configure this policy, the global default value from the [DefaultCookiesSetting](DefaultCookiesSetting.md) policy (if set) or the user's personal configuration is used for all sites.

See the [CookiesBlockedForUrls](CookiesBlockedForUrls.md) and [CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls](CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls.md) policies for more information.

Note there cannot be conflicting URL patterns set between these three policies:

- [CookiesBlockedForUrls](CookiesBlockedForUrls.md)

- CookiesAllowedForUrls

- [CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls](CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls.md)

For detailed information about valid url patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

To allow third-party cookies to be set, specify a pair of URL patterns delimited by a comma. The first value in the pair specifies the third-party site that should be allowed to use cookies. The second value in the pair specifies the top-level site that the first value should be applied on. The first value in the pair supports * but the second value does not.

To exclude cookies from being deleted on exit, configure the [SaveCookiesOnExit](SaveCookiesOnExit.md) policy.
