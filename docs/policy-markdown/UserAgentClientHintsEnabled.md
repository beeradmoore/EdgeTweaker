# UserAgentClientHintsEnabled

## Enable the User-Agent Client Hints feature (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 93.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 86, until 93

## Description

This policy is obsolete because it was intended for short-term adaptation purposes only. It doesn't work in Microsoft Edge after version 93.

When enabled the User-Agent Client Hints feature sends granular request headers that provide information about the user browser (for example, the browser version) and environment (for example, the system architecture).

This is an additive feature, but the new headers may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the User-Agent Client Hints feature is enabled. If you disable this policy, this feature is unavailable.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes

## Data type

- Boolean
