# AutofillCreditCardEnabled

## Enable AutoFill for payment instruments


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Enables Microsoft Edge's AutoFill feature and lets users auto complete payment instruments like credit or debit cards in web forms using previously stored information. This includes suggesting new payment instruments like Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) in web forms and Express Checkout.
