# MathSolverEnabled

## Let users snip a Math problem and get the solution with a step-by-step explanation in Microsoft Edge (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 125.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 91, until 125

## Description

This policy is obsoleted because Math Solver is deprecated from Edge. This policy won't work in Microsoft Edge version 126. This policy lets you manage whether users can use the Math Solver tool in Microsoft Edge or not.

If you enable or don't configure the policy, then a user can take a snip of the Math problem and get the solution including a step-by-step explanation of the solution in a Microsoft Edge side pane.

If you disable the policy, then the Math Solver tool will be disabled and users will not be able to use it.

Note: Setting the [ComponentUpdatesEnabled](ComponentUpdatesEnabled.md) policy to disabled will also disable the Math Solver component.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
