# ForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabled

## Controls whether unload event handlers can be disabled.


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 118 or later

## Description

unload event handlers are being deprecated. Whether they fire depends on the unload Permissions-Policy.
Currently, they are allowed by policy by default. In the future they will gradually move to being disallowed by default and sites must explicitly enable them using Permissions-Policy headers.
This enterprise policy can be used to opt out of this gradual deprecation by forcing the default to stay enabled.

Pages might depend on unload event handlers to save data or signal the end of a user session to the server.
This is not recommended because it's unreliable and impacts performance by blocking use of BackForwardCache.
Recommended alternatives exist, but the unload event has been used for a long time. Some applications might still rely on them.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, unload event handlers will gradually be deprecated in-line with the deprecation rollout and sites which don't set Permissions-Policy header will stop firing `unload` events.

If you enable this policy then unload event handlers will continue to work by default.
