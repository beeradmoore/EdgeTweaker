# PasswordManagerBlocklist

## Configure the list of domains for which the password manager UI (Save and Fill) will be disabled


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 99 or later

## Description

Configure the list of domains where Microsoft Edge should disable the password manager. This means that Save and Fill workflows will be disabled, ensuring that passwords for those websites can't be saved or auto filled into web forms.

If you enable this policy, the password manager will be disabled for the specified set of domains.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, password manager will work as usual for all domains.

If you configure this policy, that is, add domains for which password manager is blocked, users can't change or override the behavior in Microsoft Edge. In addition, users can't use password manager for those URLs.

## Supported features
