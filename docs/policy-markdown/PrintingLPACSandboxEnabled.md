# PrintingLPACSandboxEnabled

## Enable Printing LPAC Sandbox


## Supported versions

- On Windows since 129 or later

## Description

Setting this policy to Enabled or leaving it unset enables the LPAC Sandbox for printing services when the system configuration supports it.

Setting this policy to Disabled has a detrimental effect on Microsoft Edge's security because services used for printing might run in a weaker sandbox configuration.

Only turn this policy off if there are compatibility issues with third party software that prevent printing services from operating correctly inside the LPAC Sandbox.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes
- Can be recommended: No
- Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
- Per Profile: No
- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes

## Data type

- Boolean
