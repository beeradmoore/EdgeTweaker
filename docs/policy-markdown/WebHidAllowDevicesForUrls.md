# WebHidAllowDevicesForUrls

## Allow listed sites connect to specific HID devices


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 109 or later

## Description

This setting lets you list the URLs that specify which sites are automatically granted permission to access a HID device with the given vendor and product IDs.

Setting the policy Each item in the list requires both devices and urls fields for the item to be valid, otherwise the item is ignored.

  * Each item in the devices field must have a vendor_id and may have a product_id field.

  * Omitting the product_id field will create a policy matching any device with the specified vendor ID.

  * An item which has a product_id field without a vendor_id field is invalid and is ignored.

If you don't set this policy, that means [DefaultWebHidGuardSetting](DefaultWebHidGuardSetting.md) applies, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

For detailed information about valid url patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

URLs in this policy shouldn't conflict with those configured through [WebHidBlockedForUrls](WebHidBlockedForUrls.md). If they do, this policy takes precedence over [WebHidBlockedForUrls](WebHidBlockedForUrls.md).
