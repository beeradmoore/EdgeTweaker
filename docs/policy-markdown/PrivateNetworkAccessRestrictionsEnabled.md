# PrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabled

## Specifies whether to apply restrictions to requests to more private network endpoints


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 131 or later

## Description

Specifies whether to apply restrictions to requests to more private
network endpoints

When this policy is Enabled, any time when a warning is supposed to be displayed in the DevTools due to Private Network Access checks failing, the request is blocked.

When this policy is Disabled or unset, all Private Network Access warnings are not enforced and the requests are not blocked.

2) Its IP address is private and the other is public.
