# AutomaticHttpsDefault

## Configure Automatic HTTPS (deprecated)
> DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 92 or later

## Description

This policy lets you manage settings for [AutomaticHttpsDefault](AutomaticHttpsDefault.md), which switches connections from HTTP to HTTPS.

This feature helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks by enforcing more secure connections, but users might experience more connection errors.

Microsoft Edge attempts to upgrade some navigations from HTTP to HTTPS, when possible. This policy can be used to disable this behavior. If set to "AlwaysUpgrade" or left unset, this feature will be enabled by default.

The separate HttpAllowlist policy can be used to exempt specific hostnames or hostname patterns from being upgraded to HTTPS by this feature.

Starting in Microsoft Edge 111, "UpgradePossibleDomains" is deprecated and is treated the same as "DisableAutomaticHttps". It won't work in Microsoft Edge version 114.

Starting in Microsoft Edge 139, this policy will be replaced with the policy [HttpsUpgradesEnabled](HttpsUpgradesEnabled.md).

Policy options mapping:

* DisableAutomaticHttps (0) = Automatic HTTPS functionality is disabled.

* UpgradeCapableDomains (1) = (Deprecated) Navigations delivered over HTTP are switched to HTTPS, only on domains likely to support HTTPS.

* AlwaysUpgrade (2) = All navigations delivered over HTTP are switched to HTTPS. Connection errors might occur more often.

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.
