# CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls

## Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for specific URLs


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for the listed URLs.

This policy lets you not disclose certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs via Certificate Transparency. This lets you use certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they weren't properly publicly disclosed, but it makes it harder to detect mis-issued certificates for those hosts.

Form your URL pattern according to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). Because certificates are valid for a given hostname, independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname part of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

If you don't configure this policy, any certificate that should be disclosed via Certificate Transparency is treated as untrusted if it's not disclosed.

This policy does not work as expected with file://* wildcards.
