# DiskCacheSize

## Set disk cache size, in bytes


## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

Configures the size of the cache, in bytes, used to store files on the disk.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the provided cache size regardless of whether the user has specified the '--disk-cache-size' flag. The value specified in this policy isn't a hard boundary but rather a suggestion to the caching system; any value below a few megabytes is too small and will be rounded up to a reasonable minimum.

If you set the value of this policy to 0, the default cache size is used, and users can't change it.

If you don't configure this policy, the default size is used, but users can override it with the '--disk-cache-size' flag.

Note: The value specified in this policy is used as a hint to various cache subsystems in the browser. The aggregate disk usage of all caches may therefore be larger than (but within the same order of magnitude as) the value specified.
