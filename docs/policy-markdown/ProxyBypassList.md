# ProxyBypassList

## Configure proxy bypass rules (deprecated)
> DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

## Description

This policy is deprecated, use [ProxySettings](ProxySettings.md) instead. It won't work in Microsoft Edge version 91.

Defines a list of hosts for which Microsoft Edge bypasses any proxy.

This policy is applied only if the [ProxySettings](ProxySettings.md) policy isn't specified and you have selected either fixed_servers or pac_script in the [ProxyMode](ProxyMode.md) policy. If you selected any other mode for configuring proxy policies, don't enable or configure this policy.

If you enable this policy, you can create a list of hosts for which Microsoft Edge doesn't use a proxy.

If you don't configure this policy, no list of hosts is created for which Microsoft Edge bypasses a proxy. Leave this policy unconfigured if you've specified any other method for setting proxy policies.
