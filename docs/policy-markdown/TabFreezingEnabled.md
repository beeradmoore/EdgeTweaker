# TabFreezingEnabled

## Allow freezing of background tabs (obsolete)
> OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge version 86.

## Supported versions

- On Windows and macOS since 79, until 86

## Description

This policy doesn't work, use [SleepingTabsEnabled](SleepingTabsEnabled.md) instead.

Controls whether Microsoft Edge can freeze tabs that are in the background for at least 5 minutes.

Tab freezing reduces CPU, battery, and memory usage. Microsoft Edge uses heuristics to avoid freezing tabs that do useful work in the background, such as display notifications, play sound, and stream video.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes might be frozen.

If you disable this policy, no tabs will be frozen.

## Supported features

- Can be mandatory: Yes

- Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
